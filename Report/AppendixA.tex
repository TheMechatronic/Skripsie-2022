\chapter{End Of Life Analysis}

All electronic components that were used in this project can be reused in future projects and will thus have a vary small environmental footprint. An effort was also made to reuse old electronics where possible, both due to the concern for the environmental footprint as well as the global chip shortage that was experienced during the progress of this project.

The frame components can be cut up and reused as smaller material for projects in the future. Alternatively, the metals can be recycled. The plastic tubes that were used for the rollers would probably need to be disposed of and recycled if possible.

There were no harmful or toxic materials or consumables used during the progress of the project. Disposal and recycling of the materials and components would also not require the need for any such materials or chemicals.
