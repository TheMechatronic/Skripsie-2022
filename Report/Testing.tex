Figure~\ref{fig:test} shows the setup that was used to determine the braking torque characteristics of the built eddy current brake. The setup shows a Eurodrive servo motor connected to a rotary torque transducer. The output shaft of the torque transducer is then connected to the power roller shaft of the trainer through a series of gears and chains in order to reach higher operating speeds than the motor would otherwise ba capable of reaching.

Figure~\ref{fig:testgraph} shows the torque curves that were measured at different roller speeds. Figure~\ref{fig:sensorComp} compares the measured torque curve with maximum breaking applied at various speeds with the mathematical model of the brake. 

It is clear that the mathematical model served as a good basis for designing the brake, and that acceptable results were achieved.

Using the data that was gathered over multiple sets of tests, a surface plot could be fitted to a subset of the measurement data. Figure~\ref{fig:valid} shows the resulting surface plot that was found by fitting third order polynomials in both the x~and~y directions. A separate subset of data was then used to validate and refine the determined model.
