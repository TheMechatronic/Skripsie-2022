\Objectives{
	\textbullet \space Design and build an inexpensive bicycle trainer with controllable resistance\\
	\textbullet \space Design and implement software for connecting and interfacing with Zwift\\
	\textbullet \space Test and calibrate the resistance and connectivity of the trainer 
}

\CurrentPractice{
	\textbullet \space Commercial smart trainers that are compatible with Zwift are very expensive and thus inaccessible to many consumers\\
	\textbullet \space Accessories such as training tyres and additional cassettes also add to the costs of many available trainers
}

\NewInProject{
	The project will develop a focused product, that will be inexpensive, simple and intuitive to use and easy to maintain
}

\ProjectDifference{
	The developed trainer will make the Zwift training experience more accessible and affordable to a wider range of consumers. The trainer will also not need many accessories to use, and will be usable by many different types of bicycles
}

\ProjectRisks{
	\textbullet \space Connectivity with Zwift: There is a risk that Zwift will require proprietary software in order to connect hardware to the platform\\
	\textbullet \space Supply and manufacturing of components. There is a global shortage of components and manufacturing may be expensive and time consuming
}

\Credits{
	\textbullet \space There are various different examples of non-smart trainers on the market, which will serve as examples of what technologies work with similar products\\
	\textbullet \space There are some examples of developed BLE connectivity, as well as some libraries to enable the use of python in the development process 
}

\Continuation{
	NA
}

\ContinuationArrangements{
	\textbullet \space The developed software and electronics schematics will be available on a GitHub repository under an open license\\
	\textbullet \space The hardware design and concept will be documented and presented in this report, and in the final project poster
}
